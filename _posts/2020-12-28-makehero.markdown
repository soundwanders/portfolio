description: MakeHero is a mock character creation application that allows the user to select one of 3 heroes (Gladiator, Ninja, Samurai) and set their attributes. I created the characters and designed the background of the page to gain a better understanding of proper dimensions when designing for the web. Also experimented with different image resolutions/sizes to explore the balancing of image quality and rendering speed. Far from perfect but a highly enjoyable learning experience.
